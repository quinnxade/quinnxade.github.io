                        Howdy! My name is Quinn Gleadell. I'm a Computing major with a concentration in Cybersecurity studying at Texas A&M University. 
                        My love for computers and programming started in early High School, and from building my own PC from scratch. 
                        Since then I have gathered over 3000 hours of coding experience. In High School I was an artist and competed in multiple art competitions 
                        such as <a href="https://www.taea.org/vase/" target="_blank">VASE</a> and <a href="https://www.rodeohouston.com/Educational-Support/School-Art-Program" target="_blank">Houston Rodeo Art</a>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Entering University, I wished to combine my passion for Art with my passion for Computer Science, but I found and fell in love with Cybersecurity. 
                        I&#8217m a member of Cybersecurity club and have enjoyed participating in multiple CTFs. 
                        
                        Previously, I&#8217ve worked as a Swim Instructor at <a href="https://emlerswimschool.com/location/houston-vintage-park/" target="_blank">Emler Swim School</a> in Vintage Park, Houston for almost two years total. 
                        I found everyday to be different, exciting, and extremely rewarding to see the impact of my work. It was challenging and I learned a lot. 
                        A strong team environment is really important to me. I collaborated with a very close team of instructors, that felt like family, to inspire and teach life-saving skills to children and other adults. 
                        We empowered each-other constantly and provided constructive criticism, and it made the world of difference. I understand the importance of teamwork, 
                        it&#8217s one of my strengths and I love to contribute my ability to motivate my team members and connect with everyone I communicate with. 
                        I was able to make a lasting impact on adults and children, and that&#8217s something I&#8217d love to do more of with a career in Cybersecurity.

                    <p>
                        When I&#8217m not studying or working on artwork, I enjoy being a plant parent to 10 plants, watching Formula One, and listening to music.
                        A fun fact about me is that I'm a dual citizen. I was born in England, moved to Houston, Texas in 2006, and became an American citizen in 2018.
