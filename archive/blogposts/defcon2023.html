        <h1>Had a wonderful time at my first DEFCON!</h1>
        <p><i>- August 14, 2023</i></p>
        <p>I recently had the incredible opportunity to attend DEFCON, one of the most renowned cybersecurity conferences in the world, and it was an experience like no other. What made it even more special was that the TAMU Cybersecurity Center sponsored the trip for all the officers of our Cybersecurity club. I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity, and I couldn't wait to dive into the world of hacking, vulnerabilities, and digital intrigue.</p>


        <p>The trip was not only a great learning experience but also a fantastic bonding opportunity with my fellow club members. We shared an unforgettable adventure, filled with insightful talks, hands-on experiences, and late-night discussions about the future of cybersecurity.</p>

        <p>Being my first DEFCON, I was mainly there to soak up as much knowledge as I could. With hundreds of talks and activities to choose from, I was like a kid in a candy store. Among the many thought-provoking sessions, two in particular stood out for me.</p>

        <p>One of them was the talk titled "Abortion Access in the Age of Surveillance" by Corynne McSherry, Kate Bertash, Daly Barnett, India McKinney. The topic took me by surprise as I had never considered the intersection of cybersecurity and reproductive rights. In the wake of significant legal changes, these experts shed light on how digital surveillance is affecting individuals seeking and providing reproductive healthcare. Data tracking, often used for policing and restricting abortion access, was discussed in detail. Lawsuits and prosecutions are on the rise, emphasizing the importance of protecting online privacy and expression in this critical area.</p>

        <p>I also attended "Legend of Zelda: Use After Free (TASBot glitches OoT)" by Allan "dwangoAC" Cecil, Sauraen, MLink. This talk was a fascinating journey into the technical intricacies of hacking one of the most beloved video games, Ocarina of Time. I learned about Use After Free exploits and Arbitrary Code Execution, all while watching TASBot perform incredible feats, like taking control of an N64 live during a charity event. It was an amazing demonstration of how creativity and technical knowledge could be used for charitable purposes.</p>

        <p>Beyond the talks, I also had the chance to explore various villages, such as the car hacking village and the lockpicking village. These hands-on experiences allowed me to learn practical skills and understand the vulnerabilities in everyday technology.</p>

        <p>I also had the opportunity to watch my friend compete in the HACK-A-SAT competition in the aerospace village. It was fascinating to witness the challenges faced by the participants and how their skills were put to the test in a simulated satellite hacking environment.</p>

        <p>As I left DEFCON, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and inspiration. The cybersecurity world is vast, constantly evolving, and filled with opportunities to make a positive impact. I can't wait to go back to DEFCON next year, armed with the knowledge and experiences gained during this incredible trip.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, my first DEFCON was an eye-opening experience that broadened my horizons and made me even more passionate about the field of cybersecurity. With the support of the TAMU Cybersecurity Center, I had the privilege to learn, connect, and contribute to this dynamic community. I look forward to what the future holds in this exciting realm of technology and security.</p>
