                            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12sW9MONjF5e-Z8zFPJ6Udtc5-DHj90OWldeMZUKyVp4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Link to lab report</a>

                                Designed and verified a simple scaled down version of the processor - instruction fetch, 
                                decoder, control, ALU, registers, data memory read-write and data path components.
                                The final product was able to execute any program written using the Y86-64 ISA. 
                                This project allowed me to learn more about how programs that are executed in a computer, and the 
                                issues around program loading and boot-loading. 
                                In addition to working on the processor components, we created timing diagrams that simulates the timing and output of each stage.

                                Collaborated with a team to produce a simple, functional game. 
                                We spent a week designing and planning, then implemented our own version of Kirby Super Star Ultra's 
                                Wispy Woods level.

                                Took inspiration from the original Mario game to build a Mario platformer in Greenfoot. 
                                I utilized my object oriented programming skills to constructed my own level. Mario moves left & right, 
                                as well as crouch, with the arrow keys. Mario must avoid the Goomba enemies, holes, and piranha plants. I also created a Mario ability. 
                                Once the player obtains a "fire flower" from a mystery block, they are able to shoot fireballs. 
                                This required coding + trigonometry to help the fireballs look natural.

                                Took inspiration from the original Flappy Bird game to build a platformer in Greenfoot. 
                                Flappy "Fish" was my own spin on it. I created my own sprites, background, and animated the fish. 
                                If you keep playing, it will keep track of your highest score.

                                it's changing, constantly evolving, and exciting to learn about. I can't wait to grow my knowledge in the future.

                            I started programming with Java in High School, I developed several games using Greenfoot and BlueJ. I also learned basic Python. 
                            When I started classes at University, I mainly programmed in C++. I used Python and R for labs in my Calculus and Statistics classes.
                            I am familiar with x86-64 ASM Intel and ATT syntax, as well as Y86, and utilized it in a team project.

                                            This was the longest and most complex project I've worked on so far. It was my first full-stack application. We utilized Agile.</p>
                                           <p> Our project aimed to create a Chickfila POS system using React and JavaScript. The system was designed to provide servers and managers with a simple and effective way to navigate their orders, items, and inventory. The need for our project arose from the complexity of the current system and the lack of effective tools to manage it. Our project was needed to simplify and streamline the process of managing orders, items, and inventory, making it more efficient and effective for servers and managers. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>As the project manager, I was responsible for coordinating and managing the team's progress. My contribution as the project manager included managing the project timeline and ensuring that we met our project goals. I initiated communication among each of my teammates. I also made a significant contribution to the front-end of the project.</p>

                                            Designed and verified a simple scaled down version of the processor - instruction fetch, 
                                            decoder, control, ALU, registers, data memory read-write and data path components.
                                            The final product was able to execute any program written using the Y86-64 ISA. 
                                            This project allowed me to learn more about how programs that are executed in a computer, and the 
                                            issues around program loading and boot-loading. 
                                            In addition to working on the processor components, we created timing diagrams that simulates the timing and output of each stage.

                                            Collaborated with a team to produce a simple, functional game. 
                                            We spent a week designing and planning, then implemented our own version of Kirby Super Star Ultra's 
                                            Wispy Woods level.

                                            Took inspiration from the original Mario game to build a Mario platformer in Greenfoot. 
                                            I utilized my object oriented programming skills to constructed my own level. Mario moves left & right, 
                                            as well as crouch, with the arrow keys. Mario must avoid the Goomba enemies, holes, and piranha plants. I also created a Mario ability. 
                                            Once the player obtains a "fire flower" from a mystery block, they are able to shoot fireballs. 
                                            This required coding + trigonometry to help the fireballs look natural.

                                            Took inspiration from the original Flappy Bird game to build a platformer in Greenfoot. 
                                            Flappy "Fish" was my own spin on it. I created my own sprites, background, and animated the fish. 
                                            If you keep playing, it will keep track of your highest score.
